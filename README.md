# Heart Disease Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Project Overview
This project applies **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification to predict **Heart Disease** based on various medical attributes.  
It analyzes **different values of `k`**, evaluates **model performance**, and compares KNN with **Logistic Regression**.

---

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains **various medical attributes** that could indicate heart disease.  
Below are the key features used for classification:

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `Age`          | Patient's age |
| `Sex`          | Gender (`M = 1, F = 0`) |
| `RestingBP`    | Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg) |
| `Cholesterol`  | Serum Cholesterol (mg/dL) |
| `FastingBS`    | Fasting Blood Sugar (0 = Normal, 1 = High) |
| `MaxHR`        | Maximum Heart Rate Achieved |
| `ExerciseAngina` | Exercise-induced Angina (`0 = No, 1 = Yes`) |
| `Oldpeak`      | ST depression induced by exercise |
| `HeartDisease` | Target variable (`0 = No Disease, 1 = Has Disease`) |
